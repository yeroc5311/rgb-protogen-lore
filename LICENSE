well, this isn't my work(ish), but i *did* promise this would be FOSS forever, i'm obviously sticking with it.
permission is granted to everyone, i dont care what or who you are, just take my character cards/lore i copied and pasted and shut up.
(the repo is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, why would there be a warranty for some damn text files?)
* if something is fucked up, not my problem. dont @ me.
* this license is a obvious joke, but it kinda still counts? maybe ask your lawyer, idk

tl;dr:
* this isnt my work
* idc what or who you are, just take my character cards/lore i copied and pasted and shut up.
* something fucked up? womp womp.
