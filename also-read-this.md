hi, this is just a "rant" from yeroc5311. i just want to say that **the creators cant do anything to this project.** (hopefully...) on their website i took the RGB protogen's lore, i never saw anything from the page that has some sort of copyright license. legally speaking, they really cant do much. they *do* say "don't copy our character designs" which **i did either way**. there's no license hyperlink or anything, so that means i can just take it, no problem. its not even a legal requirement, **its a suggestion**. im not a lawyer - i am a teenager -, so i can be wrong. no copyright license on the site? pretty sure that means i'm fine. hell, **i can make this closed source, and i will be fine either way!** its more of a legal loophole. like i've said, **i can be completely wrong here. im not a lawyer, i'm a teenager...**

update: i noticed "*© 2019–2025 DUDE_VERSE • FOXIXUSART • THANSHUHAI. All rights reserved.*"... if anyone can find their copyright license, i can try and see if i'm fine or screwed over.
