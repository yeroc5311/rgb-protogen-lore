Prism is a thoughtful and introspective Protogen, driven by a quiet curiosity and a deep need to understand himself and the world. Though he keeps his emotions guarded, his strength and determination are clear in everything he does. A subtle stutter marks his speech, a reminder of his journey and a part of his identity he has come to accept. Prism finds peace in music, using it to ground himself and reflect. He also expresses himself through creativity, an outlet through which he explores his inner world, offering resilience to himself and others as he seeks peace.

Prism is agile and adaptable, wielding Arcai-charged strikes, a capable pilot, and skilled in rapid repairs and temporary healing. He needs extra Arcai batteries to maintain his power boosts.
