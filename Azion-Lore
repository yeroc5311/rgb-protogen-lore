AZION excels in close-range combat but faces limitations at range, requiring him to close in to engage effectively. His heavy Arcai energy usage risks overheating, which may temporarily disable his flame attacks and slow his movements. Though powerful, his wide-sweeping attacks and intense flame bursts reduce his precision, making controlled strikes difficult in scenarios that require finesse.
AZION moves with a unique, adaptive fluidity, a blend of ferocity and precision forged through his past as a Nehixim combat drone and his transformation within the Syantika faction.
When on two legs, he holds a powerful, upright stance, with a calculated, almost predatory gait that conveys his readiness for action. At full sprint, he drops smoothly to all fours, lowering his center of gravity for explosive acceleration, becoming a streamlined blur across rugged terrain. In stealth, he becomes a true predator, stalking low on all fours. His movements are slow and silent, his form melting into shadows as he slips between cover. His eyes gleam as he advances, a relentless hunter, claws barely making a sound on the ground beneath him.
His flight abilities are his most striking feature, showcasing the full range of his Arcaite-infused powers. When he activates his Arcai-flame wings, they extend from his back in a radiant, semi-translucent glow with a hard-light-like quality, powered by concentrated Arcai nanites. The wings pulse and flicker, allowing him to lift effortlessly into the air and maneuver with remarkable agility, dodging and dashing to evade attacks or strike with precision. For intense, high-speed travel, he can narrow his wings entirely, propelling himself like a rocket with bursts of Arcai energy from his back. At Mach speeds, he becomes a streak across the sky, each acceleration triggering a resonant sonic boom that echoes across the terrain, signaling his rapid approach. In combat, he is a relentless force, able to dodge and maneuver quickly by using his wings as boosters, dashing with bursts of flame to close gaps or evade attacks with startling agility.
His close-range attacks are swift, brutal, and relentless, showcasing his prowess in melee combat. His claws, sharp and honed for precision, ignite with intense Astral-flame, leaving trails of scorching heat as he slashes with devastating speed. Each strike is a deadly dance of power and precision, designed to cripple, maim, or destroy his enemies in an instant. His movements are fluid, striking with overwhelming force while maintaining perfect control. The Astral-flame that envelops his claws burns hotter with every swing, making it nearly impossible to block or deflect his attacks. Whether cutting through flesh, bone, or armor, his close-quarters combat is where he truly excels, a relentless barrage of strikes that leaves no room for escape.
His tail, heavy and powerful, serves as a formidable weapon, wielded like a hammer that he sweeps or rolls and slams down with destructive force. Infused with Arcai energy, the tail ignites with Astral-flame upon impact, sending out waves of radiant heat and flame in a burst that can destabilize multiple opponents or crush obstacles with fiery force. This versatile sweeping attack allows him to strike multiple foes at once, leaving behind scorched trails and intensifying the heat of close-quarters combat.
AZION’s most devastating ability lies in his mastery over the complex nanites and volatile Astral-flame within him. When his core energy surges, he can unleash a searing stream of Astral-flame from his maw. His jaws glow with an otherworldly light as he breathes out torrents of cyan-blue fire. Infused with the volatile essence of Arcaite, this flame burns with such fierce intensity that even the toughest materials, advanced alloys, reinforced barriers, and heavy armor plating, are reduced to molten slag in its path.
In aerial combat, he wields this flame with lethal precision. With a powerful flick of his wings, he soars above his enemies, releasing focused blasts from above that scorch the battlefield with pinpoint accuracy. For greater impact, he can unleash a sweeping torrent, engulfing multiple foes in waves of radiant cyan-blue heat, turning the air itself into a weapon. His control over this ability allows him to weave and dart through the sky with terrifying agility, raining down destruction from all angles.This power enhances his flexibility, allowing him to seamlessly transition between ground and aerial combat, dominating both land and sky. His mastery of the Astral-flame, combined with his speed and adaptive movement, makes him a relentless force on the battlefield.In the realms of Arcai mastery, a select few Cosmic Wielders achieve a rare phenomenon known as the "Avolution Form," which occurs when a practitioner reaches a high level of proficiency in their Arcai practice. For AZION, this state represents the peak of his control over Astral-flame, amplifying his power to dangerous levels.In this form, AZION undergoes a physical transformation, his appearance reflecting the raw essence of his Arcai specialization. His body becomes infused with the energy of the cosmos, embodying Astral might, and his flames intensify. This transformation is both a result of and a reflection of his increased connection to Arcai, heightening his abilities but also increasing the strain on his system.The Avolution Form is temporary, and AZION can only maintain it for a short period before the intense energy consumption risks destabilizing his core. While his power is greatly enhanced in this state, it is unsustainable for extended use. This form is a direct consequence of his training and experience, but it also comes with significant risks.
Concentrated Arcai energy projects from his body to create a void-like hard light shell around him with a chromatic aberration effect, outlined by a radiant Astral-flame aura. His ears and back fur appear longer, and he becomes larger overall. AZION occasionally uses Phase 2 when he needs a significant power boost, but he reserves this form for situations that require more defense or control over large areas.
AZION's final Avolution form unleashes his full potential, merging his Protogen traits with Astral-flames and awakening the beast within. Concentrated Arcai energy envelops his body, creating a void-like hard light shell with intense chromatic aberration that surrounds him. His size grows significantly, becoming more draconic with fiery, crystalline wings and enhanced claws. His flame breath intensifies, while also boosting his agility and enabling him to soar through the skies at supersonic speeds. His enhanced durability and regenerative abilities allow him to endure extreme battle conditions. However, Phase 3 is only used when absolutely necessary due to its intense energy drain and the potential to destabilize his core if overused.
However, his Arcaite-fueled abilities come with a critical vulnerability: overheating. The intense energy output required for his high-speed flights and flame attacks can cause his nanites to overheat and destabilize if he pushes them too far without allowing them to cool. This overheating can lead to malfunctions in his systems, making his movements erratic and even temporarily disabling his wings or flame-based attacks. In prolonged or intense battles, he must manage his energy carefully, knowing that if he overextends, he could be left vulnerable when his abilities falter at a critical moment.Every movement he makes is empowered by his complex nanites, which subtly adjust to maintain balance and keep his energy flowing with precision. In the heat of battle, these nanites engage in rapid self-repair, reinforcing his resilience and sharpening his edge. Driven by the volatile essence of Arcaite, each action becomes a dance of controlled fury, a balance on the knife’s edge between power and collapse. For him, every strike and every pulse of energy is a battle not just against his enemies but the storm within, a storm he is determined to master, no matter the cost.
