# rgb-protogen-lore
An attempt at creating some lore you can use for creating your own AI character cards (or getting a general sense, the lore is INSANELY HUGE!) of the RGB protogens, lore taken from https://rgb-protogens.carrd.co
[!! ]I'm sorry for "stealing" the RGB protogen lore and cutting it up and such, I've just gotten really hooked with the RGB protogen lore and their characters I couldn't help but make this. This repository will be kept private due to this. If I make this public, it will be free open source. Forever.
