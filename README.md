# rgb-protogen-lore
An attempt at cutting up some lore from https://rgb-protogens.carrd.co you can use for AI apps (or getting a general sense, the lore is *huge*!) of the RGB protogens.

[!!]I'm sorry for "stealing" the RGB protogen lore and cutting it up and such, I've just gotten really hooked with the RGB protogen lore and their characters I couldn't help but make this. **This repo will be free, open source. Forever.**

Notice: ***.jpg** is a profile picture, and ***.png** are character cards. Keep that in mind!

[You can chat with the RGB protogens on my c.ai profile, and you are free to port it to anywhere else (like i said before, this is a free open source repo!)](https://character.ai/profile/yeroc531)
